Dear Chinenye,

You're like a broken piece of me I didn't know I needed
But when I found you, it's like a picture finally taken shape
The way you love me, the way you look at me
I've never seen something like it
I've never felt this way, the intensity of how I feel
Now I love you purely
You're like my faith because now I believed
Even before I saw, you ignited something in me

I love you from my core
And I want nothing more
Just you, to share the same roof with you
Make babies with you, grow a home with you
See life through many lifetime with you
And fall in love with you in different ways
I want to hold you and make you feel safe

Written by Your Greek Boyfriend ❤️🤍
